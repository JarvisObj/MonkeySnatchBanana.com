Everyone has heard that you need to compress images on your website to get the best performance, but not everyone knows how. There are a number of programs that can help. If you use linux, I would suggest:

* pngcrush for png
* jpegtran for jpeg
* gifsicle for gif

Debian & Ubuntu both have packages for all 3. Combine with "the following script":http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3649105/compress_images.rb and you are moments away from better site performance:

{% highlight ruby %}
#!/usr/bin/ruby
require 'find'

Find.find( ARGV[0] ) do | file |
  if file.match( '\.gif$' )
    command = sprintf( 'gifsicle --batch -O2 %s', file )
    puts command
    system( command )
  end
  if file.match( '\.jpe?g$' )
    command = sprintf( 'jpegtran -copy none -optimize -outfile %s %s', file, file )
    puts command
    system( command )
  end
  if file.match( '\.png$' )
    new_file = "#{file}-crushed"
    command = sprintf( 'pngcrush -q -rem alla -brute -reduce %s %s', file, new_file )
    puts command
    system( command )
    if File.exists?( new_file )
      if File.size( new_file) < File.size( file )
        command = "mv #{new_file} #{file}"
      else
        command = "rm #{new_file}"
      end
      puts command
      system( command )
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Just pass the local filesystem root of your website to the script and it will compress all gif, jpeg and png images that it finds within the website hierarchy.
